# npm_responsive-media-queries


## Usage:

`The Breakpoint Mixin`
> `rmq_breakpoint()` mixin makes it easy to write media queries. You can use the named breakpoints, or a custom pixel, rem, or em value.
To use the mixin, call it with `@include`, and then include the CSS content you want inside the curly braces.
The behavior of the media query can be changed by adding the keyword `up`, `down` or `only` after the breakpoint value, separated by a space.
It's also possible to pass in `custom values`. You can enter a pixel, rem, or em valueâ€”all values are converted to em at the end.
Lastly, there are three special media queries that are not width-based: `portrait`, `landscape`, and `retina`. Using these keywords with the rmq_breakpoint() mixin will output a media query for device orientation or pixel density, rather than screen width.

```
.element {
  // Only affects medium screens and larger
  @include rmq_breakpoint(medium) {
    // All CSS in here goes inside the media query
  }
}
```

```
.element {
  // Only affects medium screens and smaller
  @include rmq_breakpoint(medium down) { }
  // Only affects medium screens, not small or large
  @include rmq_breakpoint(medium only) { }
}
```

```
.element {
  // Converted to 20em
  @include rmq_breakpoint(320px) { }
  // Unitless values are assumed to be pixels
  @include rmq_breakpoint(320) { }
  // Converted to 40em
  @include rmq_breakpoint(40rem) { }
}
```

```
.element {
  @include rmq_breakpoint(landscape) {
    // CSS for landscape-oriented devices only
  }
  @include rmq_breakpoint(retina) {
    // CSS for high-resolution displays only
  }
}
```
